UNDOCKING OF MV STARK AND TMC EVOLUTION

The Naval Dockyard Limited has, once again, demonstrated its capability as one of the leading dockyards in the continent through the successful docking and repairs of MV STARK and TMC EVOLUTION. Both vessels, with a combined tonnage of about 8,600 Tons, were simultaneously docked in the Yard’s 10,000 Ton capacity Graving Dock for preservative and restorative maintenance. The NDL with its well trained and motivated team supported the ships OEMs to repair the Azimuth and Bow Thrusters, conducted grid blasting, hull painting and servicing/pressure testing of about 38 sea chest valves in addition to other vital maintenance and repairs. The vessels were resultantly restored to optimum operational efficiency and safety before the vessels were subsequently undocked on Saturday 19 October 2024. The docking and repairs are indicative of the Yard’s growing contributions to the development of local participation, maritime investments and safety towards enhancing Nigeria’s Blue Economy. Kudos to the Naval Dockyard, an outstanding outfit for advancing Nigeria’s self-reliance and maritime power projection within the continent and globe!</h6>				</div>
