UNDOCKING OF MV BLACK PEARL AND BNS PENDJARI

The Naval Dockyard Limited has, once again, demonstrated its capacity as one of the leading shipyards and repair facilities in Africa by conducting the docking and repair of MV BLACK PEARL AND BNS PENDJARI. Both vessels, with over 8,000 Gross Tonnage, were docked in the 10,000Ton capacity Main Graving Dock for routine preservative and restorative maintenance. This feat, which typifies the ubiquity and versatility of the Naval Dockyard in ship construction, fabrication and repairs, was achieved through careful planning and execution of the operation. Some of the major jobs carried out on the vessels included the sandblasting and painting of the hulls and freeboards, shaft/rudder bearing replacement, alignment and polishing, as well as steel and anodes renewal. Others are; the Non-Destructive Test/Ultrasonic Test, cable ranging and marking, including the replacement/servicing/pressure testing of valves amongst others. The conduct of these repairs did not only restore the vessels to safe and efficient operating condition but will contribute to safer trade and investments as well as maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea. Hence, the Naval Dockyard stands tall as a strategic force multiplier for advancing Nigeriaâ€™s thrust in developing indigenous shipbuilding, self-reliance and human capital, promoting regional and global maritime trade and security.</h5>				</div>
