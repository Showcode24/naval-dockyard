  overview:
    "Our industrial-scale hot-dip galvanizing services provide long-lasting protection against corrosion for steel components used in marine and offshore applications. This process creates a metallurgically bonded zinc coating that shields steel from harsh environmental conditions, significantly extending service life and reducing maintenance costs.",

  keyFeatures: [
    "Complete protection including edges, welds, and recessed areas",
    "Metallurgical bond that won't peel, flake, or chip like paint",
    "50+ years of corrosion protection in marine environments",
    "Abrasion and impact resistance for demanding applications",
    "Environmentally sustainable and 100% recyclable coating",
    "No maintenance required after application",
